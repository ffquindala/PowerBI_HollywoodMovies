# Power BI Solution Development "Hollywood Movies" 
## Dashboards Deployment Link : 

## Project Goal

This tutorial continues with the Self-Service (SS) aspects of the Business Intelligence, through
a complete Business Intelligence solution, to be developed from ‘scratch’ (from zero) and entirely
within the Power BI Desktop environment. 

## Business Needs

You’re an executive in an important and prestigious Hollywood movie studio, responsible for the newly created “data scientist and market analysis” role.
The studio’s CEO wants you to prepare a wayfor the studio to study movie sales (and ticket volume) for the American market over the last few years, and how COVID
has impacted (is still impacting?...) cinema attendance.
In two days’ time, you have to sit down with the CEO and her assessors andhave a way of dynamically “slicing and dicing” the box office (market) numbers for the biggest blockbusters
of the last 6 years (from 2022back to 2017).
You’re thinking it may be time to fire up Power BI Desktop.
